## Logistic RegressionAlgorithm
- Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.
- Its a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.

## k-nearest neighbors
- The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. Itâ€™s easy to implement and understand, but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slows as the size of that data in use grows.

## SVM
- SVM: Support Vector Machine is a supervised classification algorithm where we draw a line between two different categories to differentiate between them. SVM is also known as the support vector network.

## GaussianNB
- A Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is a special type of NB algorithm. It's specifically used when the features have continuous values

## Decision Trees
- Decision trees can be used for classification as well as regression problems. The name itself suggests that it uses a flowchart like a tree structure to show the predictions that result from a series of feature-based splits. It starts with a root node and ends with a decision made by leaves.

## Random forest
- The random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees. It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.
