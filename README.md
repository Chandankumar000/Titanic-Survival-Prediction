## Linear Regression Algorithm
- Linear Regression is a very simple algorithm in which, we give in a dataset and the model try to figure out a Line of Best Fit. And finally create a linear trend (with a uniform   slope) which can be used to efficiently coin out expected outcome from a same type of data.

- Its a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
